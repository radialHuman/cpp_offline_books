# A tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup

> ## Chapter 1 - The Basic

* _The source file of the program has to be complied to produce an **object file**, which is then combined with __linker__ producing the __executable file__._

* _The executable program is created for specific harware/system combination and is not portable, the only poratble part is the source code_

> Types of entities
1. Core language feature
1. Standard library components

* _Its statically typed and the complier should know the type of the entities before using it_

> Display something
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Something\n";
}
```

* \# include is to bring in the code from other file and replace it where its called, like importing libraries
* << ("put to") operator is used to write the arugument
* std::is namespace to declare that the next following function belongs to the std library

> Functions
* Piece of code that does an operation
* Used to make the code readable and easy to debug
* *Function overloading* : If more than one fucntions are with the same name and vary in the numbe/type of parameters it can take
